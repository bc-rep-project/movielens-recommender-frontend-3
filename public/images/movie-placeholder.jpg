/* This is a placeholder file representing a movie poster image.
 * In a production environment, this would be replaced with an actual JPEG image.
 * 
 * Recommended dimensions: 300x450px (2:3 aspect ratio)

 * For development purposes, you can use an image service like:

This file would normally contain a binary image.

For a movie placeholder image, you could:
1. Create a simple placeholder image with a film icon and upload it to the project.
2. Download a stock placeholder image from a royalty-free site.
3. Use an online service to generate a placeholder.

For now, you can replace this file with a real JPG image with the dimensions of approximately 300x450 pixels to match the movie poster aspect ratio.
